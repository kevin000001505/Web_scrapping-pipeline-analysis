### Motivation

### My goal is to create a machine that can:

- Automatically scrape data from websites.
- Instantly process this data with PowerBI in Azure.

**Why Scrapy and Selenium?**

- **Selenium:** The target website utilizes JavaScript, making it challenging for traditional scraping tools to extract data. Selenium overcomes this by simulating a real user's interaction with the webpage.
  
- **Scrapy:** Known for its efficiency with large datasets, Scrapy is used to handle the volume of data more effectively than Selenium.
